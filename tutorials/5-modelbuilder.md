# Tutorial 5 - Introduction to ArcGIS Pro ModelBuilder

[ModelBuilder](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/geoprocessing/modelbuilder/what-is-modelbuilder-.htm)
is a visual programming language for building _geoprocessing_ workflows.

- Build a model by [adding and connecting data and tools](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/geoprocessing/modelbuilder/add-connect-and-modify-data-and-tools-in-a-model.htm)
- [Iteratively](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/geoprocessing/modelbuilder/iterators-for-looping.htm) process every feature class, raster, file, or table in a workspace.
- Visualize your workflow sequence as an easy-to-understand diagram.
- [Run a model](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/geoprocessing/modelbuilder/run-a-model.htm) step-by-step, up to a selected step, or run the entire model.
- [Make your model into a geoprocessing tool](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/geoprocessing/modelbuilder/create-a-model-tool.htm) that can be shared or can be used in Python scripting and other models.

In this tutorial, we will go over how to use _ModelBuilder_ to create models that
(a) automates a series of _geoprocessing_ operations, and (b) document the
_geoprocessing_ workflow through two examples:
**Identifying Suitable Area for High Residential Density Development**
and **Retention of Agriculture Land**.
