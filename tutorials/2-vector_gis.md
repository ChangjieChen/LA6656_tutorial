# Vector Operations

## 1. Selection of Features

Selecting features based on certain criteria helps you better understand the area you are interested in. Those criteria can be either the feature's own attributes (characteristics/qualities) or its spatial relationship with other features in the area.

- [Select by Attributes](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/navigation/select-features-using-attributes.htm)
  - Zoom to selection
- [Select by Location](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/navigation/select-features-by-location.htm)
- [Interactive Selection](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/navigation/selection-options.htm):
  - Selection combination mode
    - Add to (```Shift + Click```)
    - Remove from (```Ctrl + Click```)
    - Select from (```Ctrl + Shift + Click```)

## 2. Field Calculation

Datasets: [FEMA flood zone](1-software_and_data.md#critical_zones)

## 3. Spatial Join

Not only selecting but joins the attributes from features in the other dataset that meet the criterion.

## 3. Buffer

- Bus stops parcels

## 4. Clip

**Caveat**: Physically cut the geometry.

## 5. Vector storage formats in ArcGIS Pro

- Shapefile
- File GeoDatabase (length, area)

## 6. Field Calculation

## 6. Feature Class Creation and Editing

- Wildlife migration corridor (conservation)
