# GIS tutorials for LAA 6656

This set of tutorials are developed for LA 6656: Advanced Landscape Architecture Design Studio that is offered in the [School of Landscape Architecture and Planning](https://dcp.ufl.edu/slap/) at the University of Florida. With this series of tutorials, we intend to get you up to speed with the essential techniques you need to succeed the class.

## 1. Description

We encourage every student to use ArcGIS Pro as their platform of choice to do all the analysis for the project. However, you should know that knowledge and prior experience in other GIS software, such as ArcMap, is applicable and crucial as well. The skill of using GIS analysis to solve problems and strengthen your landscape design is what we hope you to learn and develop. With that being said, all the tutorials below were prepared using ArcGIS Pro.

1. [Software setup and datasets](tutorials/1-software_and_data.md)
2. Vector operations in GIS
3. Raster analysis
4. Using ModelBuilder to automate geoprocessing operations
5. Mapping suitability
